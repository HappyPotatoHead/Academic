# Methods
>[!DEFINITION] Methods
>They're just functions but inside of classes. 
>>[!DEFINITION] Function 
>They're statements group together to perform a task.

Since methods are basically functions, they posses the same benefits and rules:
- Reusability
- Easier to debug
- One function one purpose
- ...and more!

Since [[Introduction to Java#^593cb2|Java is purely OOP]], functions will be referred to as methods.

A method in Java is constructed with the formula:
`<access modifier> <datatype> <name>(<parameters>){}`
```java
public static int methodName(int x, int y){}
 ```
>[!Reminder] Static methods
>[[Introduction to Java#^434455|Static is covered here]]

**Method signature** refers to the *name(parameters)* of the method. 
```java
sum(int x, int y)
```
**Formal Parameters** refers to the variables defined in the method headers. ^a3e637
```java 
(int x, int y)
```
Methods may or may not return a value. If it does not, `void` keyword has to be specified.
```java
public static void hello(){
	System.out.println("Hello everyone");
}
```
When the return value type is specified, the method **must** return a value. If not done correctly, such issue can arise.

*Snippet A: Improper return*
```java
public static int sign(int n){
	if (n > 0)
		return 1;
	else if (n == 0)
		return 0;
	else if (n < 0)
		return -1;
}
```
When the code is written this way, Java will think it is possible that the function may not return anything. Since there is no `else` statement, if every condition is evaluated to be `false`, the method will not return anything. 

To fix this, just change the last `else if` statement into `else`

*Since Java is a language that only uses OOP paradigm, wouldn't creating an object each time you want to access a method be a hassle?*
Yes, that's why `static` keywords are introduced. It allows user to call methods without creating an instance.

```java
// if the method is a public static method
className.methodName(parameters);

// if the object is a public static object
static myClass myVeryOwnClass = new myClass();

className.objectName.methodName(parameters);

// instance method
objectName.methodName(parameters); 
```
If a method is called within the same class it is defined, it can be called directly. 
```java
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		int a = 10;
		int b = c;
		int c = max(1,b);
		System.out.printf("%d is the max of the two", c);
	}
	private int max(){
		return (a>b) ? a : b; 
	}
}
```
# Scope of variables
>[!Definition] Local Variable
>A local variable is a variable that is declared inside a method/scope (e.g. *loops*) and is destroyed when the program leaves the scope. 

*Snippet B: accessing variable outside its scope*
```java
public static void main(String[] args){
	{
		int x = 5;
		System.out.println(x);
	}
	System.out.println(x); // error
}
```
*Snippet C: Declaring variable twice*
```java
public static void main(String[] args){
	{
		int x = 5;
		System.out.println(x);
	}
	{
		int x = 5;
		System.out.println(x);
		{
			int x = 5;
		}
	}
}
```
# Passing arguments
When passing an argument to a method, the order of the variables in the [[Methods in Java#^a3e637|formal parameters]] must match in order.

Since Java is a safer language than C++, there is no manual memory management - everything is done automatically. 

Primitive datatype are passed by value while objects are passed by reference. 

This means that any changes made inside a function does not affect the original variable. 

## Method overloading
Just like in C++, method overloading occurs when more than one functions have the same name but different signatures.

*Method 1: Changing the number of arguments*
```java
static int add(int a, int b){ return a+b; }
static int add(int a, int b, int c){ return a+b+c; }
```
*Method 2: Changing the datatype of the arguments*
```java
static int add(int a, int b, int c){ return a+b; }
static double add(double a, double b, double c){ return a+b+c; }
```

>[!Warning] Changing return type
>You cannot achieve method overloading by simply changing the return type.
>```java
static int add(int a, int b){ return a+b; }
// error
static double add(int a, int b){ return a+b; }
>```

>[!WARNING] Ambiguous Invocation
>Ambiguous Invocation can happen if method overloading is done properly; two or more methods have the same name and *somewhat similar* signature.
>```java
>public double max(double x, int y){}
>public double max(int x, double y){}
>max(1,2);
>```
>In this case, since 1 and 2 can be [[Introduction to Java#Casting|widened]] to `double`, JAVA does not know which one to call.
## Pass by reference and Pass by value
By default, Java passes arguments by value - a copy of the value is made - rather than by reference. This isn't something we can control explicitly either. 

This means that when arguments are passed, any changes made to the passed values only happen in the method. The variables outside of the method aren't affected. 

This works with primitive datatype, but how about object or reference types? <br>Since reference types store the memory address of the object, changes made to the passed reference type reflects the original object as well. 

So, if you do something like this
```java
class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		int x = 5;
		Student student = new Student();
	}
	private void changeId(Student s){
		// the change affects the original object
		s.setID("123456");
	}
	private void addNumber(int x){
		// it is only 6 here
		x+=1
	}
}
```
# Lambda Expressions
A lambda expression can be used to reduce the amount of code when writing a method. By default, lambda expressions return a value. 

Instead of this,
```java
private int sum(int x, int y){
	return x + y;
}
```

You can write like this;
```java
sum = (x,y )-> x+y;
```

Calling a lambda expression is the same as calling a normal method,
```java
total = sum(5,10);
```

If your relatively short method has more than one line, '{}' can be used in lambda expression as well.
```java
sumAndPrint = (x, y)->{
			total = x+y;
			System.out.println(total);
		};
```
